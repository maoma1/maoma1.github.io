                              Having heard about the wonderful things
                              Jesus Christ has done for you, are you still wondering how to live the Christian life or come into
                              possession of everything He’s made available to you? There’s good news for you! Jesus loves you
                              the way you are and guess what? He’s not counting your sins against you. He doesn’t destroy your
                              personality. Christ died for you. He’s taken away the sin nature and all that’s associated with it
                              and set you at liberty to serve God as you should. Glory to God! Remember, Christianity is not a
                              religion.
                              Religion binds people and is itself a slave to human limitations. When you’re born again,
                              God imparts His life into your human spirit and brings you to His realm of living. You’re a
                              child of God; never be afraid of that. Don’t let anybody cheat you out of God’s best.
                              In Christ, you’re seated with Christ in the place of authority. Function with the consciousness of
                              “Your Identity” in Him and you’ll manifest the excellency of God and live the life of glory
                              He’s called you into. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17 that ‘if any man is in Christ Jesus, he’s a new creation.
                              Old things are passed away, and all things have been made new”.
                              You are a new species of being who never existed. You’re born, not after the flesh or corruptible seed, but by the Word of God
                              (1 Peter 1:23). In Christ Jesus, you are chosen, royal, holy, peculiar and righteous (1 Peter 2:9) victorious,
                              and more. You are a saint, unreproveable, and unblameable (Colossians 1:22). Now, walk in the
                              consciousness of your identity in Christ. Don’t live a mediocre life. Refuse to be weighed down
                              by your past experience or present state. You can do all things through Christ. So, rise above the
                              limitations and live the transcendent life God has made available for you in Christ Jesus.
                              You are a king priest. It’s time to rule as a king and reign in life over circumstances, sickness,
                              lack and poverty, as God purposed for you. Take charge and dominate for you are God’s expression.
