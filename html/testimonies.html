                    Read about this beautiful testimony of how this young man gave
                    <br> his life to Christ
                </h5>

                <p class="text-wrap text-white p-4" style="width: 30rem;">
                  So, we have this beautiful testimony from the 2nd edition of the Activists’ Conference in Osogbo, Osun State. It was in November 2016.
                  Pastor Tru South and five members ministered at the program and it was glorious. So many people came and the hall was filled with over 300 people. During the program, Pastor gave the altar-call and many people gave their hearts to Christ. Everybody was excited and happy, it was glorious. 
                  Once the program was over, they started packing. Everything equipment and power electricity were turned down and they were ready to go. Pastor Tru was in the Pastor’s office where the program held and he was discussing with him. Then, someone came and knocked on the door, and said to Pastor Tru that somebody wanted to see him.
                  Note that he’d never been to Osun before the program and didn’t know anybody there. He came out to meet the person who wanted to see him. It was a guy standing. Pastor asked him if he could help him. The guy answered and said he attended the program, listened to Pastor when he gave the altar-call, but refused to come out. He got up and went home when Pastor Tru was praying for those who answered the call and gave their lives to Christ.
                  The guy said as he got to his door and was about to open it, a voice told him that if he doesn’t come back to Pastor Tru, he’ll die. So, he came back so Pastor will lead him to Christ. Pastor asked him why he didn’t come out the first time and he confessed some things.

                  He said he’s the most notorious arm robber in the town. He said that he stabs people, steals their phones, their money, and he takes all kinds of drugs. He said he had prayed to God to deliver him. He had gone to churches, big pastors had prayed for him, but nothing changed. In fact, he would still go and steal after their prayers. He said he has given his heart to Christ, but he’s still stealing and doing all these terrible things. 
                  So, after Pastor’s call, he thought about the big pastors that had prayed of him and the changes that didn’t happen. He questioned Pastor Tru’s ability to do something for him, because he is young, and left. But, when he got to the entrance of his house, the Spirit told him to go back to the young Pastor or else he’d die.
                  As Pastor Tru looked at the guy, he saw that he was possessed with spirits and they were pushing him to do those terrible things. So, the first thing he did was to lead him to Christ again and filling him with the Holy Spirit. 
                  He said the salvation prayer and received Jesus Christ. Then, Pastor laid his hands on him and filled him with the Holy Ghost. As he was speaking in tongues, the demons started checking out and Pastor started casting them out. He cast out all the demons. The guy was on the floor, rolling and manifesting. 
                  When Pastor was speaking with him, his eyes were dark. But after the prayer and the casting out of demons, he eyes lit up. He stood up, he was free, excited and thankful. Pastor assigned him to a member of the Church for follow-up. Today, he is a member of the Church, Glory to God!
