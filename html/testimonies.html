                    Read about this beautiful testimony of how this young man gave
                    <br> his life to Christ
                </h5>

                <p class="text-wrap text-white p-4" style="width: 30rem;">
                  A testimony from the 2nd edition of the Activists’ Conference in November 2016 that took place in Osogbo, Osun State.
                  Pastor Tru South and a team of Activists ministered at a program in Osogbo. It was a glorious event. The hall was filled to capacity with over 300 people. After the ministering God’s word, Pastor Tru made an altar call and many present gladly gave their hearts to Christ. 
                  After the program, a gentleman came asking of Pastor Tru. Interestingly, Pastor had never been to that town neither did he know anyone there. However, Pastor met the gentleman, asked a few questions and gave him attention to hear what he had to say. He narrated that he attended the just ended Activist Program but did not respond to the altar call Pastor Tru made. He actually left the venue when the new converts were being prayed for.
                  Upon arriving home, he heard a voice instructing to return to the venue and speak to Pastor; he would die if he didn’t heed to that instruction.  For fear of death, he headed back to meet Pastor Tru and narrated his notoriety in the town; well known for robbery and other social vices.

                  Unhappy about his lifestyle, he prayed to God for deliverance and also sought help from several churches and renowned Pastors all to no avail as he will resume the same bad habits immediately after he was prayed for. Because of this, he refused to answer the altar call as he thought Pastor Tru would not be any different considering he’s even younger than the ‘big’ Pastors whose prayers could not deliver him from his habits.
                  Looking upon the gentleman, Pastor Tru perceived he was demon-possessed; and he did those terrible things under the influence of evil spirits.  Moved with compassion after hearing his story, Pastor led him to Christ and filled him with the Holy Ghost. As he began speaking in other tongues, the power of God was present such that the demons could no longer stay and started checking out of him as Pastor cast them out. 
                  Suddenly, his once darkened eyes lit up confirming his freedom from satanic bondage. To ensure his spiritual growth and maturity, Pastor assigned him to a member of the local church for follow-up. Years later, the well-known tyrant in Osogbo is now a member of Christ Embassy. Glory to God!
