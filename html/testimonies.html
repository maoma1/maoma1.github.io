                  A testimony from the 2nd edition of the Activists’ Conference in November 2016 that took place in Osogbo, Osun State.
                  We organized a program in Osogbo as a team of Activists. It was a glorious event. The hall was filled to capacity with over 300 people. After ministering God’s word, there was an altar call and many present gladly gave their hearts to Christ. 
                  After the program, a gentleman came to us. Interestingly, we had never been to that town neither did we know anyone there. However, we met the gentleman, asked a few questions and gave him attention to hear what he had to say. He narrated that he attended the just ended Activist Program but did not respond to the altar call. He actually left the venue when the new converts were being prayed for.
                  Upon arriving home, he heard a voice instructing to return to the venue and speak to us; he would die if he didn’t heed to that instruction.  For fear of death, he headed back to meet us and narrated his notoriety in the town; well known for robbery and other social vices.
                  Unhappy about his lifestyle, he prayed to God for deliverance and also sought help from several churches and renowned Pastors all to no avail as he will resume the same bad habits immediately after he was prayed for. Because of this, he refused to answer the altar call as he thought we would not be any different considering we’re younger than the ‘big’ Pastors whose prayers could not deliver him from his habits.
                  Looking upon the gentleman, we perceived he was demon-possessed; and he did those terrible things under the influence of evil spirits.  Moved with compassion after hearing his story, we led him to Christ and filled him with the Holy Ghost. As he began speaking in other tongues, the power of God was present such that the demons could no longer stay and started checking out of him as we cast them out. 
                  Suddenly, his once darkened eyes lit up confirming his freedom from satanic bondage. To ensure his spiritual growth and maturity, we assigned him to a member of the local church for follow-up. Years later, the well-known tyrant in Osogbo is now a member of Christ Embassy. Glory to God!

                In the same way, there is more joy in heaven 
                over one lost sinner who repents and returns 
                to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous 
                and haven’t strayed away!
